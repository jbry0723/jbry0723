Welcome to my Github!

I am a web developer who is seeking work in the Greater New Orleans area.

I completed Lambda School's Full Stack Web Development cirrculum. My skills are focused on Javascript, Python, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and Regex and am always interesting in learning new languages and libraries.
